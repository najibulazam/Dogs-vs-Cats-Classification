# Dogs vs Cats Classification

This project uses deep learning to classify images of dogs and cats.
It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features

* Preprocessing of image datasets.
* CNN-based model for binary image classification.
* Training and evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics.
* Prediction on custom images.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/najibulazam/Dogs-vs-Cats-Classification
   ```
2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook dogs_vs_cats_classification.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to train and test the model.

## Dataset

This project uses the [Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) from Kaggle.
You will need to download and extract it before running the notebook.

## Output

* Model training history plots.
* Accuracy and loss metrics.
* Sample predictions on test images.
